		<h2><b>High Heels</b></h2>
		<p>High-heeled shoes, also known as high heels, are a type of shoe with an angled sole. The heel in such shoes is raised above the ball of the foot. High heels cause the legs to appear longer, make the wearer appear taller, and accentuate the calf muscle.There are many types of heels in varying colors, materials, styles, and heights. High heels have been used in various ways to communicate nationality, professional affiliation, gender, and social status. High heels have been important in the West.In early 17th century Europe, for example, high heels were a sign of masculinity and high social status. It wasn't until the end of the century that this trend spread to women's fashion.By the 18th century, high-heeled shoes had split along gender lines. By this time, heels for men were chunky squares attached to riding boots or tall formal dress boots while women's high heels were narrow and pointy and often attached to slipper-like dress shoes (similar to modern heels).By the 20th century, high heels with a slim profile represented femininity; however, a thick high heel on a boot or clog was still acceptable for men.Until the 1950's, shoe heels were typically made of wood, but in recent years they have been made of a variety of materials including leather, suede, and plastic.</p>
